Riches I hold in light esteem
And Love I laugh to scorn
And lust of Fame was but a dream
That vanished with the morn--

And if I pray, the only prayer
That ove my lips for me
Is--"Leave the heart that now I bear
And give me liberty."

Yes, as my swift days near their goal
'Tis all that I implore
THrough life and death, a chainless soul
With courage to endure!
