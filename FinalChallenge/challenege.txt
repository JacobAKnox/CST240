Create a server that responds to the provided client.
The client will send two strings formatted as follows:
    <num>:<string>
After each string it will wait for any respose before sending the next.
Then it will send some number for integers as strings followed by -1.
The server should respond by returning the first string if the number
is a multiple of the first number, the second string if the number is a
multiple of the second number, and the first and second string concatenated if the
number is a multiple of both. If the number is not a multiple of either
number, the server should return the number as a string.
Stop when you recieve -1.
(play fizzbuzz with the client using arbitary strings and numbers)

You do not need to validate the input from the client.
