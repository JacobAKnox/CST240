Write a perl script that takes a list of words in a file, one on each line.
It should output any words that contains digits in them to another file, but the digits should be replaced with 'x'.

For example, if the input file contains:

    1234
    1234abc
    abc1234
    abc1234def
    abcdef

The output file should contain:

    xxxx
    xxxxabc
    abcxxxx
    abcxxxxdef
